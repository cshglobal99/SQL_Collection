Welcome to my SQL Advanced Markdown.  
This document lists the general Syntax rules for SQL and some examples.

## Future Ideas to Develop

### Variable Entries
I want to learn how to connect two tables in a way where table_2 has a column of formulas/variable based on the content of table_1.

#### For Example
**Table_1: development_costs**
| product_id | item | item_cost |
|----------|----------|----------|
|  1   | Item_1   | 100   |
|  4   | Item_2   | 200   |
|  1   | Item_3   | 100   |
|  4   | Item_5   | 25   |
|  3   | Item_1   | 35   |
|  1   | Item_6   | 125   |

**Table_2: developing_products**  
As I am still unfamiliar with code, I'll use the excel "SUMIF()" formula to show you what I mean.
| product_id | product_name | production_cost | production_cost |
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
|  1   | name_1   | descr_1   | =SUMIF( production_costs(cost_column), production_costs(product_id), products(product_id) = 1 ) |
|  2   | name_2   | descr_2  | =SUMIF( production_costs(cost_column), production_costs(product_id), products(product_id) = 2 ) |
|  3   | name_3   | descr_3   | =SUMIF( production_costs(cost_column), production_costs(product_id), products(product_id) = 3 ) |
|  4   | name_4   | descr_4   | =SUMIF( production_costs(cost_column), production_costs(product_id), products(product_id) = 4 ) |

This way as **Table_1** become populated **Table_2** 's cost column automatically updates. I don't know if SQL can do this, but was just a fun idea to think of.  

I just realised, I can create a query to produce the values I want...
> SELECT product_id, SUM(cost) FROM production_costs  
> GROUP BY product_id

Now I need to figure out how to update/replace a table with then we values.  
I managed to create this code which will update the production_costs column in table *developing_products*, however if any product_id in development_costs are not within developing_products it will not adjust for that.

>UPDATE developing_products AS DevP  
>SET production_cost = (  
>  SELECT COALESCE( SUM(item_cost),0)  
>  FROM development_costs AS DevC  
>  WHERE DevC.product_id = DevP.product_id);
>
*The COALESCE function is used to handle cases where there are no matching records in the development_costs table, ensuring that the value is set to 0 in such cases.*  

The code below will show you what product_id has not been accounted for, id est what development_cost(product_id) do not exist within the developing_products. *What this actually means is that if a product is removed or abandoned it would not have any record in **developing_products** but not necessarily removed from the development_costs. As a result, the costs would go unnoticed, therefore a code can be made to find these costs.*
>SELECT DevC.product_id  
>FROM development_costs AS DevC  
>LEFT JOIN developing_products AS DevP ON DevC.product_id = DevP.product_id  
>WHERE DevP.product_id IS NULL;  





### Automatic Entries
I want to develop some code for automatically updating tables based on another tables values.  
For instance in section: [Creating Database | Products Table](https://github.com/cshglobal99/SQL_Collection/blob/main/5.SQL_Advanced.md#automatic-entries) I want to have automation between two tables **developing_products** and **products**, where once the **developing_product**'s column "completion" hits 100%, I want information from that table to be automatically imported into the **products** table as new entires.
