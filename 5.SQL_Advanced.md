Welcome to my SQL Advanced Markdown.  
This document lists the general Syntax rules for SQL and some examples.

## Future Ideas to Develop

### Variable Entries
I want to learn how to connect two tables in a way where table_2 has a column of formulas/variable based on the content of table_1.

#### For Example
**Table_1: production_costs**
| product_id | item | cost |
|----------|----------|----------|
|  1   | Item_1   | 100   |
|  4   | Item_2   | 200   |
|  1   | Item_3   | 100   |
|  4   | Item_5   | 25   |
|  3   | Item_1   | 35   |
|  1   | Item_6   | 125   |

**Table_2: developing_products**  
As I am still unfamiliar with code, I'll use the excel "SUMIF()" formula to show you what I mean.
| product_id | product_name | cost |
|----------|----------|----------|
|  1   | name_1   | =SUMIF( production_costs(cost_column), production_costs(product_id), products(product_id) = 1 ) |
|  2   | name_2   | =SUMIF( production_costs(cost_column), production_costs(product_id), products(product_id) = 2 ) |
|  3   | name_3   | =SUMIF( production_costs(cost_column), production_costs(product_id), products(product_id) = 3 ) |
|  4   | name_4   | =SUMIF( production_costs(cost_column), production_costs(product_id), products(product_id) = 4 ) |

This way as **Table_1** become populated **Table_2** 's cost column automatically updates. I don't know if SQL can do this, but was just a fun idea to think of.

### Automatic Entries
I want to develop some code for automatically updating tables based on another tables values.  
For instance in section: [Creating Database | Products Table](https://github.com/cshglobal99/SQL_Collection/blob/main/5.SQL_Advanced.md#automatic-entries) I want to have automation between two tables **developing_products** and **products**, where once the **developing_product**'s column "completion" hits 100%, I want information from that table to be automatically imported into the **products** table as new entires.
