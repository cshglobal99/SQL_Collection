Welcome to my SQL Advanced Markdown.

## Future Ideas to Develop

### Variable Entries

### Automatic Entries
I want to develop some code for automatically updating tables based on another tables values.  
For instance in section: [Creating Database | Products Table]() I want to have automation between two tables **developing_products** and **products**, where once the **developing_product**'s column "completion" hits 100%, I want information from that table to be automatically imported into the **products** table as new entires.
