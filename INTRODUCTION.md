# Welcome to my SQL Collection.
**Last Update**: 22/08/2023  

The purpose of this project is to show my SQL ability and record my development over time. I started learning SQL at the start of August 2023 from a Udemy cource online. However, I soon realised I had no evidence of ability to showcase. So I decided to research and found GitHub to be the platform to showcase and share code. My current interest is in Data Anlytics/Science and so far I am commiting to learning {EXCEL, VBA. SQL, GitHub, Obsidian, Pyhon}. *Ideally I can find a way to merge GitHub and Obsidian, but that is somewhat in the future.*
