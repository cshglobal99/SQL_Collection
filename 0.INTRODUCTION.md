*The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate my proficiency in SQL while also documenting my progression over time. My journey into SQL commenced in early August 2023 when I enrolled in an online Udemy course. However, I quickly recognized the necessity of tangible evidence to showcase my newfound skills. In response, I embarked on a quest to identify a suitable platform, ultimately discovering GitHub as the ideal venue for sharing and exhibiting my code.*  

*My current focal point lies in the realm of Data Analytics and Science. Presently, I am dedicated to mastering a range of tools and skills, including Excel, VBA, SQL, GitHub, and Python. This multifaceted approach aligns with my aspirations to cultivate a comprehensive skill set that underpins the field. As I look ahead, I'm also intrigued by the possibility of integrating GitHub with Obsidian, although I recognize that this endeavor may be a project for the future.*

### 1) [SQL_Table](https://github.com/cshglobal99/SQL_Collection/blob/main/1.SQL_Table.md)
In this Markdown I will summarise the SQL Syntax for creating, deleting and editing Tables in an easy to read and understand manner as well as share examples of code.  
| **id** | **SectionHeader** | **Description** | **Nsubsections** |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | SQL_Table | Description_1 | 5 |
| 2 | SQL_Database | Description_2 | 1 |

> CREATE TABLE INTRODUCTION(  
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,  
SectionHeader VARCHAR(50),  
Description VARCHAR(255),  
Nsubsections int);

| id | SectionHeader | Description | Nsubsections |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | SQL_Table | Description_1 | 5 |
| 2 | SQL_Database | Description_2 | 1 |
| 3 | SQL_Constraints | Description_3 | 3 |

> INSERT INTO INTRODUCTION( SectionHeader, Description, Nsubsections)  
> VALUES ('SQL_Constraints', 'Description_3', 3);  
*Note that the "id" was not included as a value to be insereted as this is automatic due to the SERIAL Constraint. More on Constrains found below*

### 2) [SQL_Database](https://github.com/cshglobal99/SQL_Collection/blob/main/2.SQL_Database.md)
In this Markdown I will summarise the SQL Syntax for creating, deleting and editing Databases in an easy to read and understand manner as well as share examples of code.  
> *CODE INSERT HERE*  


### 3) [SQL_Constraints](https://github.com/cshglobal99/SQL_Collection/blob/main/3.SQL_Constraints.md)
In this Markdown I will summarise the SQL Syntax for Constrains used for Tables/Databses in an easy to read and understand manner as well as share examples of code.  
> *CODE INSERT HERE*  

 
### 4) [SQL_Queries](https://github.com/cshglobal99/SQL_Collection/blob/main/4.SQL_Queries.md)
In this Markdown I will summarise the SQL Syntax for Queries.
> *CODE INSERT HERE*  

### 5) [SQL_Advanced](https://github.com/cshglobal99/SQL_Collection/blob/main/5.SQL_Advanced.md)
**FUTURE DEVELOPMENT**  
This Markdown will contains code developed overtime showcasing more advanced abilities.
